# Prettier Config used by teambits

Goal: Minimal changed lines for versioning e.g. when more properties are added to an object or more parameters to an arrow function

* trailingComma: "es5"
* arrowParens: "always"

Goal: Reduce number of necessary characters (and I like it much better without all those semicolons ...)

* semi: false

Goal: Shrink file length (in terms of lines)

* printWidth: 120
